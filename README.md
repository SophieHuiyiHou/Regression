# Regression Model Project – Educational Demonstration

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating regression analysis using Python. The project includes data loading, model training, result visualization, and model serialization.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Regression.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing code and analysis
- `requirements.txt` — Required Python packages
- `README.md` — Project overview and usage instructions (this file)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply regression techniques (likely linear regression)
- Visualize regression fit using matplotlib
- Save and load model using Python's `pickle`
- Demonstrate end-to-end machine learning workflow in a simple format

## 🧪 Requirements

This notebook uses the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn` (assumed)

Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
